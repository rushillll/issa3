    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Rushil, from Dubai. I’m studying CSE at IIIT Hyderabad, and I’m part of the Debate Club and the Music Club. I love a good debate — arguing over everything from philosophy to which AR Rahman album is the best. Music’s always been a big part of my life, and I’ll pretty much listen to anything if it hits right.  

I’m also into football, both watching and pretending I’d make a great manager. And when I’m not doing that, I’m usually gaming or getting lost in a book. Philosophy and literature are my go-to when I need something to overthink.  

Tech-wise, I’m really interested in machine learning. There’s something cool about systems that can figure things out on their own. I’d like to work as a back-end engineer eventually, building stuff that’s efficient and actually useful.  

This blog’s just a space for me to share thoughts on whatever’s on my mind — football rants, music recommendations, random tech stuff, maybe even a deep dive into why “Kal Ho Naa Ho” is objectively perfect. We’ll see where it goes.</p>
